In this analysis, I will use Logistic Regression to analyze the association between no showing up in Medical appointment and SMS_received

## Brief overview: 
1. I will use Python at first to do data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. 
2. Then, I use R for statistical analysis.  
3. Finally, just a little basic predictive modelling. 

All of the steps of brief overview are done on <a href = "https://github.com/vy-phung/Data-analysis/blob/main/No_Show_Medical_Appointment.ipynb">Google Colab</a>
